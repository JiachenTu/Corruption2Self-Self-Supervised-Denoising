## Abstract

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful noninvasive diagnostic imaging tool that provides unparalleled soft tissue contrast and anatomical detail. Noise contamination, especially in accelerated and/or low-field acquisitions, can significantly degrade image quality and diagnostic accuracy. Supervised learning-based denoising approaches have achieved impressive performance but require high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) labels, which are often unavailable. Self-supervised learning holds promise to address the label scarcity issue, but existing self-supervised denoising methods tend to oversmooth fine spatial features and often yield inferior performance than supervised methods.

We introduce Corruption2Self (C2S), a novel score-based self-supervised framework for MRI denoising. At the core of C2S is a generalized denoising score matching (GDSM) loss, which extends denoising score matching to work directly with noisy observations by modeling the conditional expectation of higher-SNR images given further corrupted observations. This allows the model to effectively learn denoising across multiple noise levels directly from noisy data. Additionally, we incorporate a reparameterization of noise levels to stabilize training and enhance convergence, and introduce a detail refinement extension to balance noise reduction with the preservation of fine spatial features. Moreover, C2S can be extended to multi-contrast denoising by leveraging complementary information across different MRI contrasts.

We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among self-supervised methods and competitive results compared to supervised counterparts across varying noise conditions and MRI contrasts on the M4Raw and fastMRI datasets.
